They were admirable things for the observer\\u2014excellent for drawing the veil from men\\u2019s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion. One night\\u2014it was on the twentieth of March, 1888\\u2014I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street.\", \"I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d \\u201cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\\u201d He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. \\u201cIt came by the last post,\\u201d said he. \\u201cRead it aloud.\\u201d The note was undated, and without either signature or address. \\u201cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\\u2019clock,\\u201d it said, \\u201ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\\u201d \\u201cThis is indeed a mystery,\\u201d I remarked. \\u201cWhat do you imagine that it means?\\u201d \\u201cI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?\\u201d I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written. \\u201cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\\u201d I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion\\u2019s processes. \\u201cSuch paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.\\u201d \\u201cPeculiar\\u2014that is the very word,\\u201d said Holmes. \\u201cIt is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\\u201d I did so, and saw a large \\u201cE\\u201d with a small \\u201cg,\\u201d a \\u201cP,\\u201d and a large \\u201cG\\u201d with a small \\u201ct\\u201d woven into the texture of the paper. \\u201cWhat do you make of that?\\u201d asked Holmes.\", \"I\\u2019ve had enough of it.

He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face. \\u201cWho are you, then? What do you want?\\u201d he asked in a quavering voice. \\u201cYou will excuse me,\\u201d said Holmes blandly, \\u201cbut I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.

As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own. His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion. \\u201cWedlock suits you,\\u201d he remarked. \\u201cI think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\\u201d \\u201cSeven!\\u201d I answered. \\u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\\u201d \\u201cThen, how do you know?\\u201d \\u201cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\\u201d \\u201cMy dear Holmes,\\u201d said I, \\u201cthis is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago.\", \"Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him.

Step into my room here.\\u201d It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk. \\u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?\\u201d \\u201cI called about that beggarman, Boone\\u2014the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.\\u201d \\u201cYes.

Then there was a loud and authoritative tap. \\u201cCome in!\\u201d said Holmes. A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy. \\u201cYou had my note?\\u201d he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. \\u201cI told you that I would call.\\u201d He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address. \\u201cPray take a seat,\\u201d said Holmes. \\u201cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.

I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer.\", \"Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\\u201d \\u201cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.\\u201d I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. \\u201cIt is both, or none,\\u201d said he. \\u201cYou may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\\u201d The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \\u201cThen I must begin,\\u201d said he, \\u201cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.\\u201d \\u201cI promise,\\u201d said Holmes. \\u201cAnd I.\\u201d \\u201cYou will excuse this mask,\\u201d continued our strange visitor. \\u201cThe august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.\\u201d \\u201cI was aware of it,\\u201d said Holmes dryly. \\u201cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\\u201d \\u201cI was also aware of that,\\u201d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes. Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client. \\u201cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\\u201d he remarked, \\u201cI should be better able to advise you.\\u201d The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.\", \"You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can\\u2019t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.\\u201d He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together. \\u201cIt is simplicity itself,\\u201d said he; \\u201cmy eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\\u201d I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. \\u201cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\\u201d I remarked, \\u201cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\\u201d \\u201cQuite so,\\u201d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. \\u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\\u201d \\u201cFrequently.\\u201d \\u201cHow often?\\u201d \\u201cWell, some hundreds of times.\\u201d \\u201cThen how many are there?\\u201d \\u201cHow many? I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d \\u201cQuite so! You have not observed.

He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered.

They were admirable things for the observer\\u2014excellent for drawing the veil from men\\u2019s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own. His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion. \\u201cWedlock suits you,\\u201d he remarked. \\u201cI think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\\u201d \\u201cSeven!\\u201d I answered. \\u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\\u201d \\u201cThen, how do you know?\\u201d \\u201cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\\u201d \\u201cMy dear Holmes,\\u201d said I, \\u201cthis is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago.\", \"Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\\u201d \\u201cBut your client\\u2014\\u201d \\u201cNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\\u201d A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap. \\u201cCome in!\\u201d said Holmes. A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy. \\u201cYou had my note?\\u201d he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. \\u201cI told you that I would call.\\u201d He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address. \\u201cPray take a seat,\\u201d said Holmes. \\u201cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\\u201d \\u201cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.\", \"The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Arthur Conan Doyle This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer.\", \"Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\\u201d \\u201cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.\\u201d I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. \\u201cIt is both, or none,\\u201d said he. \\u201cYou may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\\u201d The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \\u201cThen I must begin,\\u201d said he, \\u201cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.\\u201d \\u201cI promise,\\u201d said Holmes. \\u201cAnd I.\\u201d \\u201cYou will excuse this mask,\\u201d continued our strange visitor. \\u201cThe august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.\\u201d \\u201cI was aware of it,\\u201d said Holmes dryly. \\u201cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\\u201d \\u201cI was also aware of that,\\u201d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes. Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client. \\u201cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\\u201d he remarked, \\u201cI should be better able to advise you.\\u201d The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.\", \"You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can\\u2019t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.\\u201d He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together. \\u201cIt is simplicity itself,\\u201d said he; \\u201cmy eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\\u201d I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. \\u201cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\\u201d I remarked, \\u201cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\\u201d \\u201cQuite so,\\u201d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. \\u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\\u201d \\u201cFrequently.\\u201d \\u201cHow often?\\u201d \\u201cWell, some hundreds of times.\\u201d \\u201cThen how many are there?\\u201d \\u201cHow many? I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d \\u201cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen.\", \"\\u201cHolmes, the busybody!\\u201d His smile broadened. \\u201cHolmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\\u201d Holmes chuckled heartily. \\u201cYour conversation is most entertaining,\\u201d said he. \\u201cWhen you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.\\u201d \\u201cI will go when I have had my say. Don\\u2019t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\\u201d He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands. \\u201cSee that you keep yourself out of my grip,\\u201d he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room. \\u201cHe seems a very amiable person,\\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \\u201cI am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\\u201d As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again. \\u201cFancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors\\u2019 Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.\\u201d It was nearly one o\\u2019clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures. \\u201cI have seen the will of the deceased wife,\\u201d said he. \\u201cTo determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife\\u2019s death was little short of \\u00a3 1,100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than \\u00a3 750. Each daughter can claim an income of \\u00a3 250, in case of marriage.\", \"\\u201cHolmes, the busybody!\\u201d His smile broadened. \\u201cHolmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\\u201d Holmes chuckled heartily. \\u201cYour conversation is most entertaining,\\u201d said he. \\u201cWhen you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.\\u201d \\u201cI will go when I have had my say.

It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death\\u2014!\\u201d He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands. \\u201cThey must be cunning devils,\\u201d he exclaimed at last. \\u201cHow could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!\\u201d \\u201cTo the police?\\u201d \\u201cNo; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before.\\u201d All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o\\u2019clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water. \\u201cYou are hungry,\\u201d I remarked. \\u201cStarving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast.\\u201d \\u201cNothing?\\u201d \\u201cNot a bite. I had no time to think of it.\\u201d \\u201cAnd how have you succeeded?\\u201d \\u201cWell.\\u201d \\u201cYou have a clue?\\u201d \\u201cI have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!\\u201d \\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope.\", \"\\u201cThat hurts my pride, Watson,\\u201d he said at last. \\u201cIt is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride.

Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope.\", \"\\u201cWhat do you make of that?\\u201d asked Holmes. \\u201cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\\u201d \\u201cNot at all. The \\u2018G\\u2019 with the small \\u2018t\\u2019 stands for \\u2018Gesellschaft,\\u2019 which is the German for \\u2018Company.\\u2019 It is a customary contraction like our \\u2018Co.\\u2019 \\u2018P,\\u2019 of course, stands for \\u2018Papier.\\u2019 Now for the \\u2018Eg.\\u2019 Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\\u201d He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. \\u201cEglow, Eglonitz\\u2014here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country\\u2014in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \\u2018Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.\\u2019 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?\\u201d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette. \\u201cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\\u201d I said. \\u201cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence\\u2014\\u2018This account of you we have from all quarters received.\\u2019 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\\u201d As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\\u2019 hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled. \\u201cA pair, by the sound,\\u201d said he. \\u201cYes,\\u201d he continued, glancing out of the window. \\u201cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There\\u2019s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\\u201d \\u201cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\\u201d \\u201cNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.
